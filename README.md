**GIT & GitHub:** Git is a free and open source distributed version control system that can manage everything from tiny to extremely big projects with ease. When people and teams engage on projects together, a version control system, or VCS, monitors the history of modifications. It's widely used in both open source and commercial software development, and it has a lot of advantages for teams. 

GitHub is a Git hosting repository that gives developers the tools they need to ship better work via command line tools, issues (threaded conversations), and pull requests. The whole collection of files and folders connected with a project, as well as the revision history of each file. The file history is represented by commits, which are temporal snapshots that have a linked-list relationship and may be arranged into various development lines called branches.

**Webstorm:** WebStorm is a sophisticated integrated development environment (IDE) for contemporary JavaScript development. WebStorm comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js. No other plugins are necessary. WebStorm also enables you create server-side applications using Node.js, mobile apps with React Native or Cordova, and desktop apps with Electron, in addition to client-side applications. Although the basic WebStorm functionality are still available without it, having Node.js is highly recommended.

<h1>Dfefinitions</h1>


**Branch**: Are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug—no matter how big or how small—you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your changes.

**Clone:** Is used to target an existing repository and create a clone, or copy of the target repository.


**Commit:** Captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. Committed snapshots can be thought of as “safe” versions of a project—Git will never change them unless you explicitly ask it to.


**Fetch:** Downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo.


**GIT:** Is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development


**Github:**  Is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git, plus its own features.


**Merge:** Lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.


**Merge Conflict:** Occur when competing changes are made to the same line of a file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file.


**Push:** Is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository.


**Pull:** Let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.


**Remote:** A Git repository that's hosted on the Internet or another network.


**Repository:** A directory or storage space where your projects can live
